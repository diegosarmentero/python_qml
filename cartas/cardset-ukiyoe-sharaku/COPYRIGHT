The court cards in this card set are some of the Ukiyo E wood
block prints produced by the Noh actor Toshusai Sharaku.  Sharaku
produced somewhere between 140 and 300 prints in approximately a
year in 1794-1795.  Some artistic license has been taken in
adapting these prints into a deck of cards.  Most notably, the
dark background common to many of the portraits has been replaced
with a lighter straw color similar to that found on some of them.
